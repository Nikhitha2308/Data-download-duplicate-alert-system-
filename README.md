# Data-download-duplicate-alert-system-
This project is a Python-based system designed to prevent duplicate file downloads by checking if a file already exists in the database before allowing a new download. If the user tries to download the same file again, the system triggers an alert message to notify them and block redundancy.

âœ… Tracks all downloaded files using an SQLite database

âœ… Alerts the user if they attempt to download a file that already exists

âœ… Simple Tkinter GUI popup alerts for better user experience

âœ… Lightweight and efficient design for integration with other applications





ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack

Python 3

SQLite3 for database management

Tkinter for GUI alerts




ðŸ”¹ Use Case
This system is useful in scenarios where maintaining unique file downloads is criticalâ€”such as in data storage systems, digital libraries, or content delivery applicationsâ€”to avoid unnecessary duplication and save storage space.
